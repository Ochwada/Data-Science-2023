## Introduction

The "Photos into Cartoons" project utilizes image processing techniques to convert standard photographs into cartoon-style images. This effect is achieved by applying various transformations, such as edge detection and color filtering, to produce a stylized rendition of the original image.

## Features

- Convert images to cartoon-like representations.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code implementation.
- Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ochwada/Data-Science-2023.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Data-Science-2023/Photos\ into\ Cartoons/
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.*

## Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook photo_to_catoons.ipynb
   ```
2. **Follow the instructions within the notebook to upload your image and apply the cartoon effect.**

## Examples

Here are some examples of images before and after applying the cartoon effect:
